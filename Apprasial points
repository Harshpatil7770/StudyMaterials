5) POC ( 1 Performance improvement over the application ) 
A) JMSTemplate we are using to send msg over the queue.
  The performance of JmsTemplate is very low ,
  it took almost 45 min to process the 30K msg.
  As we know that we have to support the throughtputs.
  For this purpose we need to reduce the time of put operation over the queue.
  For this case put operation taking 60 to 300 ms if there is load.

B) Did poc , using core javax.jms api.
   Implemented logic on local code, deployed on dev env.
   Tested to check the performance.
   Foe this case put operation taking 0 to 30 ms if there is load.
   90k input able to process within 17 min.
