AWS Solutions Architecture.

1) What is AWS?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AWS stands amazon web service.
It is cloud provider. It provide the essential resource specilaly in an IT sector such as storage,network, server or etc.
As pay as you go basics.

AWS provide us a lot's of services such as
EC2,RDS, VPC, IAM , 


2) AWS clous history
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2002 - Launched Internally at amazon.com
2004 - launched SQS 
2006- S3 and EC2

3) AWS Global regions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A) Region
Region is nothing but geoprahical area. Region present all around the word.
for eg - US-EAST-1 

4) How to AWS Regions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THere is certian factor first we have to consider the before choosing the correct aws regions
A) Latency - Latency means suppose you deployeped your application in mumabai regions and you are trying to access it from
             US or UK you will get some latency. 
B) pricing - Pricing will vary from region to region. 

C) Available services - all updated feature or services not get availbel in small regions immmediately AS COMPARTED TO LARFE ONE

B) Availability zones.
Under each region there will be availablity zones.
each regions have mainly three availabilty zones.
3 min and 3 max.

for eg- mumabi, mumbai-east-2a
                mumbai-west-2a
                mumbai-southeast-2a



C) Point of presence (Edge locations)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THe main function of Point of presence a deliver content with low latency.


5) AWS Gloabal service
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gloabal service means is not specific to the regions , it's available each regions gloablly.

A) IAM
B) ROuter 53
C) Cloud Front (Content delivery network)
D) WAF (Web application framework)

6) Most of aws services are regiosn scoped
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A) Amazon EC2 (Infrastructure as services0
B) Elastic beanstalk (platform as service)
C) Lambda (Function  as service)

7) IAM
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IAM stands for Identity Access management.
Whenever you joined any orgazantion they will provide you IAM username and password.
TO access the aws services.
Under the IAM service thwy will add you into specific group and user that the username
provide to you.
So you can access only those services.

Root account not goint to use , no one goiign to share.

IAM --->  
Gruop --->  Name : Dev
user ---> who are the developer will add into it.

User and group get assigned in json format

8) What is Group in IAM?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Group is nothing but group of people which working on same tasks.
like dev, qa , devops

9) What is User?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User is nothing but consumer, under the group we will ad the user , so it can use the specific mentioned services.
If users get's forget it's password then only root user can reset it.

10) IAM Policies
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IAM is not authorized to create the groups or useres.
'
11) MFA
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MFA stands for Multi-factor authentications.

A IAM root can itself assing MFA.
Use microsoft authenticator

12) AWS CLI
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AWS CLI Stands command line interface.
Using AWS CLI We can interact with aws services.

AWS cli is helpful to direct acess the public APIS


13) AWS SDK
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AWS SDK softwate devlopement kit.
It is embeded with your applications.

14) How to create Acces key
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

15) AWS Cloud shell
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16) Role
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IAM Role for services.
It is just like users ,but not inded to use the users.
It will get used on EC2 instance, when you want to do some operatipns and assing permisssion to the AWS services with IAM roles.

17) Practially have to assing IAM
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18) How to create Roles in AWS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
19) Budgets
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We can set Budgets optios to get an alert , that much bill or amount is excced.

20) EC2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EC2 stands for elastic cloud compute , it is virtual machine.
Operatiing system - windows, linux, os
CPU
RAM
Storage Space- EBS & EFS Network based, harsware EC2 Instance stor
Network card - public ip address
Firewall rules - security groups
Bootstrasp script - EC2 user data

21) EC2 Instance type
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
T2 micro - 1 cpu 1 1gb memeory 
T2 medium

When you stop and start the EC2 instance public ipv4 get changed.
Whereas private ip is not going to change.
Web server in cloud . (Ec2 instance ) Virtual machine

22) EC2 Instance Types
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A) General purpose
B) Compute optimized
C) Memeory optimized
D) Accelarated optimized
E) Storage optimized
F) Instance optimized
G) Measuring instance performance

23) General purpose
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General Purpose we can use t2 micro.
It maintain the balance between the memory, cpu and network.

24) Compute optimzed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compute optimzed is good for high performance requirment, if there is batch processing workloads theen compute optimzed is good.
It has high performance web servers. 

25) Memory optimized
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Memory optimized used for ralations and non- relational databasees.
High performance

Memory optimized in aws currenlty belongs R series.

26) Security groups
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Security groups only contain allows rules.
Security group responsible for in and out traffic into EC2 instance.

Security group are firewall on ec2 instance.
Security groups attched to multiple instace, i.e there is no one to one relational.
Security groups belong to the vpc/regions if you switched it. then you have to create new one.


27) SSH
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SSH- SSH Stands for Secure shell

FTP- File tranfer protocol

SFTP - Secured file transfer protocol

HTTP- access unsecured

HTTTPS - access security website

RDP - remte desktop protocol

28) EC2 Instance Purchase options
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) EC2 Instance purchase options . 
A) On Demands - short workloads.
B) Reserved 1 and 3 years - long workloads and flexible instances
C) Saving plan 1 and 3 years - long workloads and commit with the amount of usage
D) Spot instance - short workloads, cheap , at any time you can loose this instance and less reliable
E) Dedicated hosts- book entire servers, control instance placement
F) Dedicate instances - no other customer will share you the hardware
G) Capacity reseervations - reserved specific capacity for any durations


29) EC2 On Demand
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will get billing as you used, 
Recommoned for short workloads, un-interruoted for workloads
No upfront payments.
No long term commintment

30) Reserved instance
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reserved instances 
upto 72% dis as compared to on demand,
Reservation period from 1 year to 3 year will get the discounts.
It is Regional or zonal scoped.
You can buy and sell reserved instance in Marketplace.

31) EC2 saving plans
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Will get 72% discounts.
Reservation period from 1 to 3 years i.e comminted period for ex 10$/per hr for 1 to 3 year
if limit is excced they will charge on demand basics

32) EC2 Spot instane
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
you will get discuount upto 90% as compared to on demand
But you can loose your instance at any times.
THis is the least expensive options

33) EC2 Dedicated hosts
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A physical servers with EC2 instance capacity.
You need to pay as per active dedicated hosts,
reserved 1 to 3 years 
THis is most expensive option.

34) Private and pUblic ip
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
public ipv4 - It's always unique, mc identify over the www . It will get changes once you stop and start the ec2 instance.
              To keep one then you have to use elastic ip.
              You have to allocate elastic ip to public ip.
private ipv6 - THe mc get's identify over the proviate network only. Two different prviate network has same ip address.



34) Elastic ip
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are using normal public ip and you can start and stop it.
it will get changed.

But if you don't want to change then you need elastic ip.

Elastic ip is costly.

35) EC2 Capacity of reserations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No time commitment, create and cancel it anytime , but there is no discounts.
you are charged at on demand wheather your instance run or not.

36) Placement groups
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

37) What is the difference between EC2 Instance stop vs EC2 instance hibernate?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EC2 Instance stop fully shut down the instance. Whenever you do this then RAM content is getting are lost.
 When you start it again it will from fully startup process. Wheneved you do this it will take 2 min start the process
Whereas 
EC2 Instance hibernate means instance goes on hibernate mode. When you do this then RAM content is getting stored.
When you start your instance it will start from the resumed place only. Whenever ypu do this it will take zero minute to start it

38) How to enable hibernate on EC2 instance?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you are going to create EC2 instance that time, you have select hibernate option as enable.
