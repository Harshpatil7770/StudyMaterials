AWS Solutions Architecture.

1) What is AWS?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AWS stands amazon web service.
It is cloud provider. It provide the essential resource specilaly in an IT sector such as storage,network, server or etc.
As pay as you go basics.

AWS provide us a lot's of services such as
EC2,RDS, VPC, IAM , S3, Route53  , IAM  , EFS , EBS.


2) AWS clous history
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2002 - Launched Internally at amazon.com
2004 - launched SQS 
2006- S3 and EC2  ( It is offcilally launched) 

3) AWS Global regions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A) Region
Region is nothing but geoprahical area. Region present all around the word.
for eg - paris, europe etc.

4) How to choose AWS Regions or what factor first we have to consider while choosing the resion.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THere is certian factor first we have to consider the before choosing the correct aws regions
A) Latency - Latency means suppose you deployeped your application in mumabai regions and you are trying to access it from
             US or UK you will get some latency. 
B) pricing - Pricing will vary from region to region. 

C) Available services - all updated feature or services not get availbel in small regions immmediately AS COMPARTED TO LARFE ONE

B) Availability zones.
Under each region there will be availablity zones.
each regions have mainly three availabilty zones.
3 min and 3 max.

for eg- mumabi, mumbai-east-2a
                mumbai-west-2a
                mumbai-southeast-2a



C) Point of presence (Edge locations)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THe main function of Point of presence a deliver content with low latency.


5) AWS Gloabal service
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gloabal service means is not specific to the regions , it's available each regions gloablly.

A) IAM
B) ROuter 53
C) Cloud Front (Content delivery network)
D) WAF (Web application framework)

6) Most of aws services are regiosn scoped
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A) Amazon EC2 (Infrastructure as services0
B) Elastic beanstalk (platform as service)
C) Lambda (Function  as service)

7) IAM
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IAM stands for Identity Access management.
Whenever you joined any orgazantion they will provide you IAM username and password.
TO access the aws services.
Under the IAM service thwy will add you into specific group and user that the username
provide to you.
So you can access only those services.

Root account not goint to use , no one goiign to share.

IAM --->   IAM role direclty assing to EC2 m/c , to avoid short term creditional.
Gruop --->  Name : Dev
user ---> who are the developer will add into it.

User and group get assigned in json format

8) What is Group in IAM?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Group is nothing but group of people which working on same tasks.
like dev, qa , devops

9) What is User?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User is nothing but consumer, under the group we will ad the user , so it can use the specific mentioned services.
If users get's forget it's password then only root user can reset it.

10) IAM Policies
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IAM is not authorized to create the groups or useres.
'
11) MFA
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MFA stands for Multi-factor authentications.

A IAM root can itself assing MFA.
Use microsoft authenticator

12) AWS CLI
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AWS CLI Stands command line interface.
Using AWS CLI We can interact with aws services.

AWS cli is helpful to direct acess the public APIS

15) AWS Cloud shell
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16) Role
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IAM Role for services.
It is just like users ,but not inded to use the users.
It will get used on EC2 instance, when you want to do some operatipns and assing permisssion to the AWS services with IAM roles.

17) Practially have to assing IAM
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18) How to create Roles in AWS

High performance

Memory optimized in aws currenlty belongs R series.

26) Security groups
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Security groups only contain allows rules.
Security group responsible for in and out traffic into EC2 instance.

Security group are firewall on ec2 instance.
Security groups attched to multiple instace, i.e there is no one to one relational.
Security groups belong to the vpc/regions if you switched it. then you have to create new one.


27) SSH
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SSH- SSH Stands for Secure shell

FTP- File tranfer protocol

SFTP - Secured file transfer protocol

HTTP- access unsecured

29) EC2 On Demand
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will get billing as you used, 
Recommoned for short workloads, un-interruoted for workloads
No upfront payments.
No long term commintment

30) Reserved instance
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reserved instances 
upto 72% dis as compared to on demand,
Reservation period from 1 year to 3 year will get the discounts.
It is Regional or zonal scoped.
You can buy and sell reserved instance in Marketplace.

31) EC2 saving plans
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Will get 72% discounts.
Reservation period from 1 to 3 years i.e comminted period for ex 10$/per hr for 1 to 3 year
if limit is excced they will charge on demand basics

32) EC2 Spot instane
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
you will get discuount upto 90% as compared to on demand
But you can loose your instance at any times.
THis is the least expensive options

33) EC2 Dedicated hosts
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A physical servers with EC2 instance capacity.
You need to pay as per active dedicated hosts,
reserved 1 to 3 years 
THis is most expensive option.

34) Private and pUblic ip
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
public ipv4 - It's always unique, mc identify over the www . It will get changes once you stop and start the ec2 instance.
              To keep one then you have to use elastic ip.
              You have to allocate elastic ip to public ip.
private ipv6 - THe mc get's identify over the proviate network only. Two different prviate network has same ip address.



34) Elastic ip
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are using normal public ip and you can start and stop it.
it will get changed.

But if you don't want to change then you need elastic ip.

Elastic ip is costly.

35) EC2 Capacity of reserations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No time commitment, create and cancel it anytime , but there is no discounts.
you are charged at on demand wheather your instance run or not.

36) Placement groups
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

37) What is the difference between EC2 Instance stop vs EC2 instance hibernate?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EC2 Instance stop fully shut down the instance. Whenever you do this then RAM content is getting are lost. When you start it again it will from fully startup process. Wheneved you do this it will take 2 min start the process
Whereas 
EC2 Instance hibernate means instance goes on hibernate mode. When you do this then RAM content is getting stored.
When you start your instance it will start from the resumed place only. Whenever ypu do this it will take zero minute to start it

When you are going to create EC2 instance that time, you have select hibernate option as enable.

39) What is EBS?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EBS Stands for elastic block storage service provided by aws . You can attach to it to your EC2 instance, it's like a 
virtual hard drive for your virtual server.
EBS will store the data even if you stop or terminate the EC2 instance.

Without EBS what will happesn , if you stop or terminate the EC2 instance then local data get lost forever.
you have to manage data replication or backup solution to own, scalling is more complicated.

40) AMI
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) AMI stands for amazon machine image.
2) AMI basically used to create virtual server on aws cloud.It has operating system, software and setting
alreday setup.

AMI is template of virtual server. when you want to create new server , so instead creating form scrach link , os and software installing,
things simple you can use AMI  for thatr.

41) EC2 Instance store

43) EFS 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EFS Stands for elastic file system.
EFS is scalable and managed file storage services in AWS.
Managed storage service means user don't need to worry about the hardware and sotware of complexity to store the data
EFS is mutliregion network file.
EFS is great way to share the data into different zones.

44) EBS Vs EFS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EBS stands for elastic block storage volume whereas EFS stands for elastic file system.
EBS get attched at a time one instance expect multi-attched feature.
For migration we need to take the spanshot and restore it to the another AZ.

The main difference between EBS and EFS is EBS is used to persist the data , not for reflectons whereas 
EFS is used to to replicate data across all the Azones.
But primary focus of EFS is provide scalable and shared file storage within a single region.
where as S3 bucket provide data replicate and storage across all the avaibablity zones.

    A. Scale vertically to a larger EC2 instance size.
    B. Scale horizontally across multiple Availability Zones.
    C. Purchase an EC2 Dedicated Instance.
    D. Change the EC2 instance family to a compute optimized instance.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amith Bhanudas Aug 11, 11:59
Correct Answer - B. Scale horizontally across multiple Availability Zones.

Amith Bhanudas Aug 11, 12:04
A "horizontally scalable" system is one that can increase capacity by adding more computers to the system. This is in contrast to a "vertically scalable" system, which is constrained to running its processes on only one computer; in such systems the only way to increase performance is to add more resources into one computer in the form of faster (or more) CPUs, memory or storage.

Horizontally scalable systems are oftentimes able to outperform vertically scalable systems by enabling parallel execution of workloads and distributing those across many different computers.

    C. High economies of scale
    D. Increased deployment time to market
    E. Increased fixed expenses

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amith Bhanudas Aug 11, 12:27
Correct Answers 

B. Ability to quickly change required capacity

C. High economies of scale
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/six-advantages-of-cloud-computing.html
Benefit from massive economies of scale – By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay as-you-go prices.
Stop guessing capacity – Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you often end up either sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can access as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes’ notice.

    B. Security groups
    C. AWS WAF
    D. Amazon GuardDuty

Kumar Arya Aug 14, 12:12
C

Amith Bhanudas Aug 14, 12:37
Correct Answer - B. Security groups
Security Groups are Stateful (retains state of incoming traffic and allows reciprocal outbound traffic without having to configure outbound). They operate on Instance Level

NACLs are stateless (need to configure for both incoming and outgoing traffic separately.

WAFs are for Web applications and although they can be used, they are not the most appropriate for this use case.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Security groups - secuirty group is nothing but stateful firewall.
                  security group basically maintain the allow rules.
                  basically the main purpose of firewall to control in and out trafic in aws resources.
