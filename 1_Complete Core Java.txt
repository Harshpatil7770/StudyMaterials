1) What is Java and explain histroy of JAVA | Why Java is simple language | How are we remvoing unreferenced object in java |
  What is object oriented programming language | What are the feature of Java | Where Java used ?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Java is object oriented programming lanaguage. Java developed by james gosling and 
first run by sun microsystem.Java is derived by language c++.
Java is simple langauage. It follow the WORA Concepts i.e write once run anywhere.
There is no need to remove unreferenced object manually because java Uses garbage collector to remove unreference object automatically.
object oriented programming language menas everything is made of objects.
Object oriented means we organize a application has different combination objects that incorpated with datastucture and behaviour. We can do programming by using object oriented.

According to sun microsystem more than 3 billions devices uses java. Java used in many cases such as things on mobile games,trading apps,business app etc.

A) Java is simple   

Java is simple because it simply based on language c++.Java doesn't support concepts such as pointer and explicit overloading. There is no need to remove unreferenced object manually it removed by garbage collector automatically.
 
B) Platform Indepdent  

Platform independent means it's byte code run on mutiple platfrom.
Platform -Hardware or software environment on byte code runs
Hardware- Physical entity related to our machine
Software- collection of codes which is installed on your hard drive.

c)robust  

Robust means it has very powerful and strong transaction management capability.   

d) Multithreaded    

Multithreaded means multiple thread execute simultaneously at a same time. 
We can achieve multitaking with the help of multithreaded.

e) secure 

It's byte code run inside the jvm. Remove many confisuion such as operator overloading and explicit pointers.

f) architectural netrual

There is no implementation dependent feaures.

g) High perfomance   

Java uses just time compiler to make performance fast. It is better and faster than other traditional interpreter. 

h) distributed    

We can create distributed application with the help of RMI and EJB.

i) portable

Portable means we can run it's byte code on multiple platform.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) What is byte code?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
byte code is intermediate between the java programs allows JVM to convert byte code into machine level assembly instruction.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) What are the Oops concepts? or Explain oops methodology?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oops stands for object oriented programming language. oops methodlogy has been derived single concepts i.e objects.
In Java Basically we have four oops concepts or we have four pillars of java
Abstraction 
Polymorphism
Encapsulation
Inheritance

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A) Abstraction
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstraction is way to hide the implementation and show some features.

Abstraction achieved by 
1)by using interface
2)By using abstract class

Abstract class - 

Abstract class is used to achieve 0 to 100% abstraction.  If you want to use abstract method then the class must be abstract. whatever method  declare inside an abstract class it must be implement in subclass. abstract class have constructor, static member and method also it support both method declaration and defiantion. abstract class never instantiated.we can't make abstract method static in java. Because whatever method declared inside abstract class it must be implements in subclass. if you declare abstract method is static so it's unnecessary become the part of class. A class contain abstract class as a member. abstract class nested i.e we can declare one abstract class inside another abstract class. we can't declare abstract method as synchronized. we can declare local inner class as abstract. abstract method declaration include through clauses. we have constructor in abstract class. It is used to intilize a object.
A method declared without using body is called abstract method.
we can't use abstract keyword with constructor,instance intializr block,static initilization block

 We can't instantiated an abstract class then why constrctor allowed in abstract class?
Because we create a object of subclass and from subclass constructor we can call abstract class constructor even we don't provide any constructor then also compiler provide by default.
Basically constructor allows in abstract class to initiialze the attribute values.
We can't instantite abstract class because it has some incompleted methods.

If we achieve 100% abstraction by using interface then why we using abstract class?
abstract class used to show some properties to the customer and hide rest of all that's why we require abstract class.

If you want to use abstract method then class must be abstract.
we can't use abstract and final both with method because abstract method must be implement in subclass. 

for eg - sending sms to someone you just type and sent it , intenrnally you don't know what happen.
automobile steering or break, ATM machine.

Rules for abstract class 
If you want to use abstract method then the class must be abstract.
Abstract class never instantiated.
Abstract class have  static variable and method also.
hatever method declare an abstract class it must be implements in subclass.
If you declare a class is abstract then it not neccesarry it have atleast one abstract method

Why we use abstract class
abstract class is used to achieve 0 to 100% abstration.
By Using abstract class we can show some propeties to the user and hide some.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
A -VIII) What is the difference between abstract class and interface?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
               Abstract class                                         Interface
1) abstract class is used to achive 0 to 100% abstraction.      1)Interface is used to achieve 100% abstration
2)abstact class have constructor                                2)Interface don't have constructor
3)abstract class have both method declaration and method        3)Interface has only method declaration
  defination 
4)In abstract class we can use static variable and members      4)Interface by default member are public static and final whereas method are     public and abstract.
5) abstract class is uesd in larger project because it provide common  5) Interface used in smaller project if we want add or force some method.
  method implementations to all subclasses.                                                (If you want to hide all feature then will go for interface)
  ( If you want to hide some feature and show some then 
    will go for abstract class.)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
												
B)Polymorphism
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
polymorphims is greek word poly means many and morphs means forms,
i.e polymorphism means many forms. we can perfoms a single action into multiple forms.
There are two types of polymorphism 

for eg - 
a person some time it act as father,son,employee,husband or etc.

 Advantages of Polymorphism   - 
Reduce lot's of lines of code.
Debug application easily.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B)What are the types of polymorphism in java?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B-I)   Compile Time polymorphism-
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compile time polymorphism is achived by using method overloading.
Method overloading means a same method name , but different parameter (In terms number of different parameter or the attribute type are different). we can override the overloaded method.
Compile time polymorphism performs is faster than the runtime polymorphism.
It is also know as static binding.

public void test(int i) {
		
}
	
public void test(String val) {
		
}

public void test(int i, int j) {
		
}


method oveloading is achieved by two ways
1)By chnaging no. arguments
2)By chnaging no. data type
But not possible by using or chnaging return type because it create ambugity in the program.

Advantages - 
1) Method overloading increase readablity of the program.
2) cleanliness of the code.
       
B-II)   Runtime Polymorphism (Return type is not matter in runtime polymorphims due to covarinat return type).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Runtime polymorphism is achived by using method overriding.
Method overriding means a class and subclass will contain the same method , with same paramter, return type does not matter only covariant case ( suppose parent one return type is object and child class can return String , Integer etc.
The performs of method overriding is slower than the compile time polymorphism.
It is also know as dynamic binding.
												
*** Runtime polymorphism we required same exception also
*** Return type doesn't matter.

  Method overding rules

    A) Same method signature required.i.e same method name with same argument
    B) Return type same required before java 1.4 
       from 1.5 covariant return allowed.
       covariant return type- Child variable return type doesn't need to match with parent variable
                              return type.
       Covariant return type applicable for only object not primitive type.
       Return type not matter

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B-X) What is the difference between method overloading and method overriding?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        method overloading                                                                   method overriding
1) method overloading is used to achieve compile time polymorphism  1)method overriding is used to acheive runtime polymorphism.
2) method overloading means a class in java has multiple same       2)method overriding means a classes in java has same method  
    method name with different parameter                                            name with same arguements 
3) It is also called as static binding                              3) It is called as dyanamic binding
4) performs of method overloading is faster than the method overdidng  4)Performs of method overiding is slower than the 
    method overloading beacause object is determined at compile time                   because object determined 
   at runtime.
                    
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C) Inheritance
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inheritance means inherit properties from one class to another class.
Inheritance represnt IS-A relatioship or parent child relatioship.
parent class- The class inherit properties from another class called parent class.
child class- The class inherit feature of parent class called child class.

Types of Inheriance 

1) Single Inheritance
single inhertiance means only one child class derived from the parent class
for eg. class Bank, class SBI extends Bank

2) Multilevel Inheritance

only one child class derived from the parent class now the child class act as parent class of another class.
Class Person , class Employee extends Person, class Manager extends Employee

3) Hierarchical Inheritance
Hierarchical inheritance means a class has more than one child class.
for eg class Bank,class SBI extends Bank, class HDFC extends Bank

4) Multiple Inheritnace
A class has more than one parent class, Java doesn't support multiple inheritance in class.
Multiple inheritance is implements by using interface.

5) Hybrid Inheritance
Hybrid inheritance is combination of single and multiple inheritance.due to ambugity or diamond shape java doesn't support hybrid inheritance.
 
 C-II) Advantages of Inheritance

1) Without inheritance we can't achieve runtime polymporphism
2) code redusablity.

C-III) The real life example of inheritance
1) Parent and child, child inherite all propeties of his father

C-VI)Can children class inherit the properties constructor of it's parent class?
 No,children class not inherit properties constructor of it's parent class.

Inheritance represent IS-A relationship i.e parent child relations.
The class inherit properites from another class.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 D)Encapsulation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Encapsulation means wrapping up data or hide a data as single entity.
for eg- capsule,java bean
To use encapsualtion we need to make all member of class is private.

Encapsulation is the way of data hiding.To make data hiding means we need to create all varibles of class is private.

D-I) Real life example
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Capsule

D-II) Advantage of encapsulation

1)To make read only or write only application.
2)control over the data and data security
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------7 
A)What is differnce between abstraction and encapsulation?       
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          Abstraction                                                     Encapsulation
1) Abstraction is the process of hiding the details or   1) Encapsulation means wrapping up data or hide a data as single entity.
    implementaions by showing main services.
2) Abstration solve the problem upto design level        2) Encapsulation solve the problem upto implementation level
3) For eg- sending sms to someone you just type and      3) for eg- java bean, capsule
  send it you don't know the internal process,
  Automible sterring, automobile break,ATM machine
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) What is class in java?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Class is blueprint from which objects are created.
2) Class is logical entity.
3) Class created only once, it doesn't allocate memory at the time of creation.
4) Class is created by using class keyword for eg- class employee.
5) A class can't extends itselft in java.
6) We can't assign superclass to subclass
7) we can't extends more than one class in java.
 IS-A

for eg- SBI--------> BANK
(subclass)       (superclass)

other names of class
 1) Model
 2)JAVA BEAN
 3) Entity
 4) POJO POJO stands for plain old java object. it also called as java bean. It has only fields and methods.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) What is object in java?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)Object is instance of class.
 2)Object is created as per our requirement.
 3)Whenever it created it allocated memory.
 4)Object is nothing but real word entity such as pen,paper,laptop or mobile or etc.
 5)Object is created by using new keyword
 for eg- Employee employee=new Employee();

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6) What is Interface? 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interface same like as class the main difference that interface doesn't have body and constrctor also.
Interface also represent IS-A relationship.
Interface is used to achieve 100% abstraction.
Interface have only method declaration not method definition. By default interface method are public and abstract and variables are public, static and final Whatever method declare an interface we must need to implements in subclass. We need to initialize variable at that time of declarations. Interface never instantiated. Interface is achieve multiple inheritance.
we can't declare interface method is static because they default public and abstract.
 Interface is not final is java. because whatever method declare inside the interface we must need to implement 
 subclass. we can't define private and protected modifier for the member in interfaces because they default public,static and final.
 an object reference cast an interface reference. When object implement reference variable .
we can't declare interface method is static because they by default public and abstract.



we can't declare interface as final. 
if we define concrete method inside an interface It will shown compile time error.
if we not intialized variable inside an interface It will shown compile time errror.


interface never inherit in subclass.An interface can inherit multiple interfaces but cannot inherit a class. 

Why we use interface
Interface mainly used to acieve 100% abstraction.
By using interface we can achieve multiple inheritance.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7) What is tightly encapsuled bond in java?

To make all variable of class private is tightly encapsulated class in java

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8)  What is package?
Package is group of similar classes, Interface and subclasses.
advantage of package
-1) To avoid name clashes.
 2)Package provide data access protection

create package in IDE

open the IDE software--> click on new --> file--> new project  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9) Explain main method?

 Public static void main(String args[])
 public - public is access modifier keyword. public means access from anywhere within the class, within the package, outside the 
 package,outside the class.
we can't declare main method private or protected because jvm read only public method.
JVM read only public access modifier if you put private, protected, default it not visiable for jvm.
 
static - static is non access modifier keyword. static means belong to class not an object.Jvm doesn't reuire to create object for 
call main method.

main method is static because jvm don't need to create object to call the main method. 
if the static modifier is removed from the signature of the main method , It compile succesfully but at runtime they show error ie. main method is not static please define main method as static

void- main method return type is void. ie. it doesn't return anything.
we can't change main method return type it must be void.
main method doesn't return anything. after the exisitng of main method we want ot close the application.

main- it is just startup of your application

 
(string args[])- string represent sequence of character. args[] is arguments
main method doesn't take arguement than String args[]
i.e commod line arguments. To pass parameter to the main method we need to use it. OTHER data type easily convert in the form of string

No, it's not posssible to override the main method. we can overload the main method.

 public static void main instead of static public void main() then program compile succesfully and run it. because order sequence is not matter in java.

we are not able to execute program without main method. It's possible before java 1.7.

we can declare main method is final. public final static void main(String args[])

 we can make main method synchronized.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10)Expalin System.out.println()?

System- System is final class present in java.lang package
out- out is static variable of present in class system of type printstream
println() - println is method od the printstream class.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11) What is the difference between println and print?

Println add new line after message get displayed where as print doesn't add new line after message get displayed.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12) What is variable and it's type?

Variable is separate piece of memory that contain data values specified by an identifier.
Types of variable 

1)Local variable                                                                           
local varibale means declared within the method,block and constructor. 
default value of loacal variable depend on the data types which are you using like boolean it is false, int it is o like that.
local variable we can make final and main thing is that no any other modifier we can use with local variable.


2) Global variable                                                                 
- global variable is also known as instance variable. it declared outside the method, block , constructor and inside the class.
  for int,byte,short.long is 0, boolean is false, object is null,float,double 0.0.

3)static variable                                                                   
 - static variable is also known as class variable, because it allocate memory while loading of class. It mainly used for 
  memory mangement

What is the diffrence between global and local variable?

                 Local variable                                                   Global variable
1) Local variable is declared inside the method,                1)Global variable is declared outside the method, variable, constructor and inside the class
                                                                                              block and constructor.


What is the difference between global and static variable

                 global variable                                                          static variable
1) Global variable also known as instance varible.           1)static variable is also known as class variable.
2) global variable doesn't allocated memory at the           2)static variable allocated memory while loading of class.
 time of creation of varible 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13) What is Data type and explain it's ?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data type specified size and type value that can specified by an identifier.
There are two types of data types
 A) Primitive data type  -
 1) Primitive data type means predefined in java
 2) It always start with lowercase letter
 3) size of primitive data type depends uopn the type of the data
 4) It never null.

In java there are eight primitive data type
1)byte 
2)short
3)int
4)long
5)float
6)double
7)boolean
8)char

 
B)Non primitive data type
Non primirive data type means they are not predefined in java.
1) It may or may not be empty
2) Size of all primitive data type are same
3) It start with uppercase letter
                          
Types of non primitive data types
1) Array  
2) Class
3) interface 
4) String
                         
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14) What is Modifier and it's types?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modifier specifies scope of the class,methods,block and constructors.
There are two types of modifier in Java

There is no difference between access modifier and access specifier both are same. It specifies scope of class,method,variable,constructor.

Access modifier specifies scope of the class,method,block and constructor.
There are four access modifier in java
       
A)Public          -
public means access from anywhere within the class, outside the class within the package outside the package also.

B)Private      -  

private means access only within the class.
we can't override the private method.
If varibale is declared private It access only within the class.
you can restrict the member of class from inheriting it's subclass To make all member of class is private.

C)Protected   

protected means access within the package outside the package but only thorugh inheritance.
we can't declare a class is protected.
the access scope of protected method within the class within the package and outside the package but only thorough inheritance.


 D)Default       -                                            

default means access only within the class and package only.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
-A) Can we change the scope of the overidden method in the subclass ?

Yes, we can change the scope of overridden method in subclass. But take care that the scope can't decrese
for eg. public remains public  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-B) Can we modify throws clause of the subclass method while overriding it in the subclass?

Yes, we can modify throws clause of subclass method while overrding in the subclass.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
c ) Write access modifier increase with there visiablity?

private ---> default ---> protected ----> public
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
d ) How many public clases a.java file have?

It has maximum one public class
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
e) Top level class can be private or protected?

No, a top level class can't be private or protected it must be public or no any other acess modifier..
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2)Non access modifier

In java there are seven non access modifier keyoword used to transfer information of there behavoiur to JVM.
1) final 2) static 3) abstract 4) synchronized 5) natice 6) volatile 7) transient

1)static - 

static keyword or non access modifier mainly used for memory management.
static means belong to class not an object.
static keyoword used with method, block and variable.
static member isn't inherit to subclass.

1-A) static variable

If you declare a variable is static it allocate memory at the time of loading of class.
static variable is mainly used for memory management. for eg. student college name.
Once you declare a varible static and intialized it we can change it value in static block.

static method
If you declare a method is static means we don't need to create object of that class to call it. we can directly to static method.
Once you declare a method by using keyword static is called static method. static method we can't access this and super keywords.
we can't override the static method. this keyword is used to refer static member.
once we declare a method by using keyword static is called static method, so it's become part of the class. or static means belong to class not an object.  we can overload the static method in java. static method called without called without creating object of that class whereas non static method require object of that class to call it. we can't override private and static method in java.
Yes we can declare static method is private.

static block
If you declare a block is static we can chnage static variable values inside the block. Static block allows only static variable and it execute before the main method.


Adavantage of static keyword
static keyword mainly used for memory management.


What is the difference between static and instance method?
              static method                                                instance method
1) a method declare by using keyword static          1)a method dosen't required to declared by using any keyword 
                                                      called instance method.
called static method.
2) static method don't need to create the object     2)instance method required to create object of that class to call it.
                                                        of that class to call it. 
we can call direclty.



What is the difference between static block and instance block?

                 static block                                                 instance block
1) a block declared by using keyword static is called static block.       1)A block doesn't reuired any keyword to declare it called instance block.
2)In static block we access static variable                               2)In an instance block we can access the instance variable.
3)static block executed before the main method.                           3)instance block executed when object of class is created

2) final -

final is non access modifier keyword is used to restrict the user.
final is used with class,variable,method.
A class declared by using keyword final is called final class. Once we declare a class is final we can't inherit it in subclass. we can't extends final class. inal class is used to restrict the user from inheriting in subclass.
abstract method must be implement in subclass whereas final method never override.yes we can create object of final class

final variable

If you declare a varible with keyword final is called final variable.once we declare a variable is final and intialize it we can't change it's values.
If you declare a variable is final and not initilized it so it's called final blank variable. we can initilize it in constructor only.
final variable serialized in java.
static final variable means constant.

final method 
If you declare method is final we can't override it in subclass. But final method get overload.


                  static keyword                                             final keyword

1)  static keyword is used for memeory management                   1) final keyword is used to restrict the user.  
2)  static keyoword is used with variable,method and block          2) final keyword is used with class, variable ,method
3)  static method called without creating object of that class      3) To call final method we need to create object of that  class.
4) once we declare a variable is static and initilzed it we can change it  
                                                                    4) once we declare variable is final and 
                                                                                        initilize it called 
chnage it value in static block.                                                                                 we are not able to change it's value                        
5) static variable is loaded at the while laoding of class          5) final variable doesn't load at the time of declaration


3) abstract

If you want to declare a method abstract then the class must be abstract class. abstract is used to achieve 0 to 100% abstraction.


What is the difference between abstract class and final class

                         abstract class                                               final class
1) abstrct class is declared by using keyword abstract        1) final class is declared by using final
 2) abstract class never instantited                           2) final class instantiaited
3) abstract class declared method must be implement in subclass 3) final method can't override
4) abstract class is used to achieve abstraction               4) final class is used to restrict the user.
                                                                                                                              

 4) synchronized

synchronization means capability to access mutliple thread to any shared resource.

5) transient

transient keyword is to skip member while seriliazing an object.

6) volatile

volatile means value read from main memory not a specific memory.
Volatile keyword mainly used to achieve safety threads

7) native
native means they came from old version.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15)  What is method?

method is block code it run when it calls.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
23) What is constructor and explain in brief?

Constructor is special technique used to initialize the object. 
constructor called automatically when object of that class is created. 
It is called constrcutor because it construct the value at the time of object creation.
If you don't provide any constructor in the class then comipler provides default constructor.
Explicitly constructor doesn't return anything but internally constructor return current instance of that class.
we can have two constructor in java class called constructor overloading means same constructor name with different parameter.
Constructor chaining means calling one class constructor from another class with current instance of class.
Constructor used with public,private,protected or default.
Default constructor is used to get default values of the objects such as 0,null depends upon the data type.
Parameterized constructor is used to proivde different values to distinct obejcts.
private constrctor is used to restrict the other user from creating object of that class.
To make singleton class we use private constructor ie. that class has only one object is created as per the class defination.
it's not possible to call sub class constructor from super class.
we can't have constructor in an interface.
we have class with no constructor in it, but at time of loading of class compiler provide default constructor.
If you already define constructor in class then compiler don't provide anything.
Protected constructor means preventing to create object of that class from outside the package.
constructor can't be final in java Because constructor never inherit.
onstructor can't abstract in java because abstract means it doesn't have body. constructor will automatically called when object of class is created and it has body also.
constructor can't be static in java because static menas belong to the class not an object so there is non sense constructor is static.
constructor and instance initilizr block inherited to subclass.
Calling one class constructor to another class constructor with current instance of that class.
 constructor never inherited.we can overload the constructor, i.e a class in java has same constructor name with different arguments.
we can't make constructor final because constructor never inherit. Java doesn't suppoert copy construtor because it create confusion.
Copy constructor is method that used to intialize one object by using another object of same class.
we can't make constructor static. because static means belong to the class not an object and constructor will automatically called when object of class is created.

There are two tyeps of constructor 
1)Parameterized constructor-A constructor with an argument called parameterized constrctor
2)Non parameterized constructor-A constructor with no argument called non-paramerterized constructor.

The rules for constructor

1) Constructor name same as the class name.
2) Constructor first line shoud be this or super keyword.
3) Constructor internally return current instance of that class 
4) Constructor use with only access modifier keyword not non access modifier keyword.

constructor chaining be done using this keyowrd
 this keyword is reference variable that refere current instance of that class.
 this keyword is used to call current class costructor,method,variable.
 this keyword is used to calll one class constructor to another class constructor with curreent instance of that class.

Syntax for default and parameterized constructor
 default constructor 
 constructorname(){}.
 parameterized constructor 
 constructorname(arguement1,arguement2){}   

If you provide return type in constructor it doesn't behave like constructor it behave like normal method.and it will shown one warning message that method name same as constructor  name  

we can't make construct abstract because abstract menas they don't  have body and constructor will automatically when object of class is created  it has body also.


constructor name same as class name because
when we create object of class by using new keyword and it has some specific information of about that class.  

constructor in java private, To make singleton class we need to create private constrcutor.

Constructor doesn't have any return type.

this keyword is used to call another constructor of same class, whereas
super keyword is used to call another class constructor.

JVM stands for java virtual machine.
It an abstract machine does not exist physically.It provide an environement to execute to byte code.
It mainly follows the steps such as
1) code loader
2) verify code
3) executing code
4) Provide runtime environment
             
JVM memory areas such as
1)Method area   - Method area is used to store instrcution for static and non static method.
2)stack         - 
                   stack is collections of frames which hold local variable and partial result that placed in part method calling and 
                   return. Stack follow LIFO manner last in first out.
3) Queue         - Queue follows FIFO manner that is first in first out manner.
4) Pc register   - Pc register stands for program controller register.It used to store the address of currently executing statement.
5) native method stack - Native means comes from old version

JDK stands for java development kit.It is combination of JVM,JRE and other software development tool.
JDK is used to develop actual application in java.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
36) What happen if superclass and subclass having same filed name?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then to access super class we neeed to use super keyword.
This situation is also called as filed hiding.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

mutuable object means can modified or editiable whereas immutable means can't be modified or editiable.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
49) Where object is stored in memory?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Objects are stored in heap memory.
Heap memory - heap memory used to for dyanmic memory allocation , where object and varaible are created runtime.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
50) What is memory leak?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Memory leak is situation occur when object present in the heap memory which are not longer used and garbage collector unable to remove it.They are unnecessarly maintained.                      
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
51) What is the differnce between instance and object?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instance always have a defination 
Employee employee=new Employee();
whereas object may or may not have defination
int array[];

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
53) Why Pointer is not used in java?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pointer create confusion in the program and increase ambugity of the program.
Java is simple language i.e., 
Pointer is not used in java
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
54) What is JIT?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JIT stands for just in time compiler. 
It is part of JVM which used to improve the performance of application.
JIT imporve performance of your application by compling byte code into native machine code.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
55) How object is created?

1) If we don't provide any constructor in the class then constructor          1)In case of method compiler don't 
                                                                                provide anything.
 provide default constrcutor.                                                                                               
2) Constructor called implicitly.                                            2)Method called explicity.
3)constructor explicity doesn't return any values                            3)method return values.
4)Constructor name same as class name                                        4)method name may or may not same as class name

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
57) What is the difference between break and continue?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 Break                                                                   continue
1) break is used in swith and loop                                             1)continue is used only loop
2)break means stops the execution of that loop.                                2)continue means doesn't terminate the program come to next iteration.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
58) What is infinte loop?

Infinite loop occur when condition always evalute true. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
59) What is the this and super keyoword?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
this keyowrd is used to referes the current the instance of that class. this keyword is used to call current class constructor, method and variable. 
whereas super keyword is used to call parent class constructor,method and variable.

we can call method by using this keyword.

we can call method by using this keyword from constructor.

it's not possible to assign reference to this.
we can return this from method.
we can pass this as parameter or method.
 we can use this to refer static member.
it's not possible to use this in static block, static methods

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                        
60) What is interpreter?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interpreter is used to tranform byte code into machine level assembly instruction.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
61) What is class loader? and it's types
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Class loader is subsystem of jvm. when you run the program it loaded first.

Types of class loader

1) BootStrap class loader -   BootStrap class loader is parent for all class loader.
                              It loads all the claases like java.lang.* and java.util.*.

2) Extension class loader  -  Extension class loader loaded all ext directory classes. 
                              It is child class of bootStrap class loader.
3) Application class loader - Application class loader is child class of extension class loader.
                              It loads all the classes from application class path.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
62) How classloader works in java?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
class loader scan all the related location of jar files and classes.It also load all the required file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
63) What is the difference between data and information?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------          
                 Data                                         Information
1) Data is unprocessed row format                1) Information is processd well format
2) Data is huge in format                        2) Information is short format
3) Data is not meaningful                        3) Infomation is meaningful
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
64) What are other oops concepts?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Association , Aggregation , Composition
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
64- A) What is Association?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://github.com/Harshpatil7770/Concepts/tree/master/AssocitionAggregationComposition
Association represent the general relation between the object.
It represent one-to-one , one-to-many, many-to-many relationship.
for eg - student and course.

class Student{
private long studentId;
private String studentName;
private Course course;
}

class Course {
private String name
}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
64- B) What is aggregation?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://github.com/Harshpatil7770/Concepts/tree/master/AssocitionAggregationComposition
Aggregation represent one object ownes the another object , but still the owned object can exist independently.

class Library {
private List<Book> bookLists;
}

class Book {
private String bookName;
}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
64- C) What is composition?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://github.com/Harshpatil7770/Concepts/tree/master/AssocitionAggregationComposition
Composition represent a parent object ownes complete child object.
if we delete parent object then child object don't have their own life.
for e.g., - House and room 
class House{
private String address;
private Room room;
}

class Room {
String name;
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
64- D)How many ways to implement relation in java?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
There are mutilple ways to implement relation in java.
1) Association 
2)Aggregation 
3)Inheritance
4)composition 
----------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------
64- E) Which is more tighlty bond inheritance or composition?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Composition is more tightly bond as compared to inheritance.  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
64- F) When will you prefer composition over inheritance?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If there is proper IS-A relationship then we will go for inhertiace if there is some cofusion we will go for composition.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
64- G)How aggregation and composition are different concepts?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
because aggregation represent weak relationship whereas composition represent strong relationship.
i) aggregation means parent object ownes the child object but if you destroy the parent object then also child object have their own
   indepedent life.
for e.g.,- Library and book

ii) Composition means parent object ownes the child object but if you destroy the parent object then automatically child
    object get destroyed. so child object don't have their own life.
for e.g., - House and room
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
65) What is marker interface?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marker interface means empty interface.
It doesn't have any method or fileds.
marker means it is getting used to mark or tag , so treat differently.
If class has tag with this marker interface then treat differently.

clonable , serializable , remote are the marker interface.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
66) What is object cloning in java?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Object cloning means creating new object without using new keyword.
There types of object cloning in java
A) Shallow copy
B) Deep copy
																      
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
67) Write a syntax for creating the subclass of class? 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
class subclassName extends superclassName

extends keyword is used to inherit the class or used to define subclass

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
69) Can we access subclass method if we create an object of superclass?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, we can't accesss subclass method if we create object of superclass.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
70) Can we access both superclass & subclass member if we create an object of subclass?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, we can access both subclass and superclass member if we  create object of subclass.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
71) What happens if both superclass and subclass have a filed with same name?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you create the object of subclass then you need to use super keyword to access super class members.
This situation is also known as filed hiding.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
72) What is the use of pointer in c?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pointer is used to store the address of object another variable
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
73) What are the supported platform for java programming language?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Java programming lanaguage supports on many platfrom such as windows,linux,ubntu. os etc
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

75) What is the difference between java and c++?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------              
                  Java                                                          C++
    1)Java is application programing                            1)C++ is system programming
    2)java doesn't support mutliple Inheritance in              2)C++ support mutilple inheritance in class. 
                                                                                class 
    3) Java doesn't support goto statement                      3)C++ support goto statement
    4) Java doesn't support pointer                             4)C++ support pointer
    5) Java doesn't suppoet operator overloading                5)C++ support operator overloading
   6) Java support only call by value                           6)C++ support call by value and call by reference
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
76) What is th difference between java platform and other platform?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Java is software based platform whereas other are software and harware based platform.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
77) Who gives java write once and run anywhere nature?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Byte code gives java WORA concepts. - byte code is intermediate represenations of java                                                   
programs allows jvm to transfer byte code into machine level assemebly instrcution.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
78) Is Empty.Java file name valid source file name?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
yes, empty.java is valid source file name
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
79) Is delete,main,next or exit,null keyword in java?
 No, delete,exit,main ,null is not keyword is java
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
80) If you don't provide any argument in the commond line then what will be value stored in string array passed into the main() method,empty or null?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Empty but never null.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
84) Can we have virtual function in java? ######################
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes we have virtual function in java.
 All non static method are virtual function.only final and private method are non virtual.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
85) Why java is not 100% pure object orinted?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because java support primitive data type which are not objects such as int,byte,short etc.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
86) What is product based and service based companies?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Product based companies design their own product or application before client approch them or reaches them. whereas service based companies work only if client reaches them approche them for specific reuqiements and needs.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
87) What is procudure language?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Procedural language means follows top to down approch i.e step by step.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
88) What is the difference between equals() and (==)equal to?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
equals() method is used for content comparision where as equal to(==) operator is used  for address comparision.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
89) What is wrapper class?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wrapper class is used to convert primitive data type into object.
All Wrapper classes are Immutable classes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      
Primitive data type                                                       objects

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
181) Explain scope or life time of local variables in java?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
local variable is declared inside the method,block,and constructor.
once method is excuted the local varible get deleted from memeory.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
183) Explain Enumeration ?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enumeration feature added in java 1.5. Enumerations means set of constants. It declared by using keyword enum. Inside the enum class member public,static and final. We can't instantited enum and we can't extends also.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
184) Explain restrictions on using enum?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We can't instantiate a enum. we can't extends enum.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
185) Explain field hiding in java?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If super class and subclass having same filed then filed hiding happen. If we create the object of child class and to access the super class we need to super keyword.
							 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
186) Can we use switch statement with Strings?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
yes we can switch statement with strings.							    
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
187) Explain about object oriented programming and its features?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
object oriented programming language means every is made up of object. it follows bottom up approch.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
188) List out benefits of object oriented programming language?	
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) code reusablity
2) easy maintance
3) realible
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
189) Define Iterator and methods in Iterator?							  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Iterator is getting used to perfrom traverse operation over the element.
It traverse the element only in forward direction. 
It has method like remove(), hasNext() , next() etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
190) Define ListIterator and methods in ListIterator?							  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ListIterator is used to travel element in both forward and reverse direction.
It used in onlt List. 
Methods of ListIterator is 
1) boolean hasNext() --- return present if there is element
2) next() --- return next element if there is no element it will show noSuchElementException
3) remove() --- It remove the element.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
191) Difference between for loop Vs Iterator in Java ? 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For Loop 
i) For loop is getting used the access the element using index.
ii) We can traverse the list forward and reverse direction.
iii) you can't modify the collection while iterating the for loop.

Iterator
i) Iterator is getting used to perfrom operation on collection or , you are able to
    modify the collection while doing iterator.
ii) It traverse only forward direction.
iii) It works with list, set , array.
iv) it has method such as remove() , hasNext() , next()							  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
191)  What are alternatives to java serialization?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are two alternatives of java serialization. 
1) xml based - xml based is done by using JAXB( java architecture for xml binding) 
   It provide two mechanism 
  1) marshling - means convert java object into xml whereas
  2) unmarshling- means convert xml into java object.
2) Json based- JSON stands for java script object notations . 
   It is light weight format for storing and transporting the data.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
192) How to make object serializable in java?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
first we need to implement our class by serlizable interface.
objectOutputStream is used for write the objects, wheras objectInputStream is used to read the objects.

What is the purpose of serialVersionId in serilization?
The serialVersionId getting used while performing serilization , deserilization.
Basically it avoid versionCompatability problems.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
193) Can we serialize static variables in java	?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No we can't seriliaze static variable in java, because static varibale are class variable not anobjects. whereas serlizable mechanism is used for only to travel the state objects over the network not a class state.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
194) When we serialize an object does the serialization mechanism saves its references too?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When we serialize an object then the refer must be serilizable> If we don't make this we will get NoSerlizableException.
							 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
195) If we don’t want some of the fields not to serialize How to do that?	
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Transient keyword is used to skip member while serializing an object.
							
## For child class
There is no direct way to avoid serilization of your objects we need to use readObject and writeObject methods and throws NotSerliableException. otherwise we need to use transieny keyword so it zero or null values.
							
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
196) How to achieve method hiding?	
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
method hiding is acheived by using method overding by making method static.
							
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
197) What are the immutable classes in java?	
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All Wrapper classes are immutable in java.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
198) Distingwhich between .java file and .class file?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.java file is writed by human .ie source code.
.class file generated file compiler i.e byte code.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
199) What is the difference between blank and empty in java?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
isBlank basically check the white spaces in the string.
isEmpty check character in the String.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
200) IsEmpty() and IsBlank() and length() ?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IsEmpty() - isEmpty means nothing is there, no blank space and no character.
IsBlank- isBlank means if there is String with no character just white spaces, it will detect that.
length() - for length!=0 we can restrict the user.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
201) IDE shortcurts
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) ctrl+s = save
2) ctrl+shift+f = format of code
3) ctrl+d= delete to-do generate line
4) ctrl+shift+o = organzation import
4) ctrl+l = go to line
5) ctrl+g on method = to check call hierar
6) ctrl+f = to find 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
202) How to change JDK version in java? 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Suppose if you are using jdk 1.5 and now if you want to chnage it into java 1.8.
Just right click on your project 
1) select build path
2) select library
3) click on Java version
4) Edit
5) add 1.8 java path.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
203) What are the solid principle in java?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The solid principle is nothing but five important principle we need to keep in mind during developing
our project.
1) S stands for Single responsiblity principle -
     single responsiblity principle means a class should have single responsiblity.
for eg - a class is during data manupation and same class is doing notofications sending operation , it is not a good.
         make separate out them.

2) O stands for open closed principle -  
        open closed priciple means a class should open for extends , but closed for modification.

3) l stands for liskov substituion principle - 
         liskov substituion principle means you should able to replace a class without breaking a program.
        for eg you added class Dog which extends class Animal

4) i stands for Interface seggregation priciple - 
        Interface seggreation principle means make small -small interface, so don't need to force to implement it.

5) d stand for dependency inversion principle - 
        high level class should not depend upon the low level class. 
        for eg - interface engine{
                  void start();  
                 }

                 class PetrolEngine implement engine{
                 }

                 class GasEngine implement engine{
                 }

                  
204) What is volatile keyword in java?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Volatile keyword is used with variable . 
If the variable value is going to chnage multiple times to visible latest value to everyone, we need
volatile keyword.
it read the value from main memory not a specific memory.


205) What will happen if we define constructor as private?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you define constructor so object access only within the class.
To restrict the others creating objects from outside the class.

206) Can a class extends more than one class in java?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, a class can't extends more than one class in java. But a class implements more than one interface in java.

207) What is type casting in java?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Type Casting means conversion of one data type to another type.
for eg String to Integer

209) What is co-variant return type in java?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Co-varinat return type , In method overrding return type won't matter.

for e.g., - 
i) Parent class method return object, then class can return anything like Interger, String.
ii) If parent class method return Number , then child class can return Integer, double , float.

Object - all classes in Java
Number - Integer, Long , double , float
charSequnce - string , stringBuffer, String Builder
Throwable - Exception , error
Collection - list , set , map


213) When we get null pointer exception in java?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you a object which has null value and you try to get value from it , you will the null pointer exception.
for eg - you have employee object as emp = null,
and you are trying to access emp.getId(); you will get the null pointer exception.


214) How to restrict the user to inherit the class without using final keyword.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
To restrict the user make parent class constructor as private , whenever you try to inherit
Parent class constructor not visible for the the subclass constructor.

215) Who broke the singelton design pattern.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://github.com/Harshpatil7770/Concepts/tree/master/SingletonDesginPattern

1) Reflection
2) Serialization and deserialization
3) Clonebale 

1) Reflection - i) means Java api basically allow to call private constructor from outside the class.
                ii) to overcome with this issue when constructor is getting called if instance is alreday created 
                    you can simple throw RuntimeException()
                iii) means ways overcome with all issue is enum.

2) Serialization and deserialization - 
                 i) While serialization and deserialization java will create new instance , which breaks the singleton design pattern.
                 ii) To avoid this use readResolve() method when serilization or deserilization is happen get the instance which
                     already created.

3) Cloning  - i) Implmeneting cloneable interface clone method also break the singleton desing pattern.
              ii) To overcome with this throw cloneNotSupportException();
  
 218) Return Type with access modifier rule?
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  1) It possible to increae the scope of access modifier in subclaas but not posible to decrese that.
  2) Protected - Protected,Protected - public === True
  3) protected- default , private === wrong scenario    ( Compile time errror) 
  4) Public - Public True   Public - Protected = False scenario
  5) Public - default, public - private - false scenario
  6) default- default True scenario, default- public True scenario
  7) default- protected True, default -private false


  220) What is scala language?
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  scala is a scalable language. 
  It doesn't have any boiler plate code.
  It is function programming.
  
  221) What is groovy language?
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) Groovy language means static and dyanamic language. ( static language means variable with their data type checked at compile time.
     where dyanamic language means variable with thier data type checked at runtime).
  2) Groovy language is used for scripting language for java platform.
  
 
  222) What is transpiler?
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Transpiler means convert one source code into another source code.
  or convert one lagungage into another langauge.
  or migration of laguage as per thier version.
  
  223) What is serilization?
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Serilization means convert the object into byte stream.
It help to travel the state of object over the network.
 
 // Real world example of serilization like
 If you have boolean and you want to send as gift to someone which live in other city.
 If you try to send with filled air it may chances of damage, or it will 
 occupies more space.Instead of this we can send it without filled air.once that recieve
 they can filled air for using purpose.
 
 
 224) Why we need of custom serilization ?
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 When we use transient keyword there may be chances of data losses.
 To avoid this we required custome serlization.
 for eg -
 class A{
 int id=10
 String username="harsh";
 transient String password="23213";
 
 }

10 harsh null

TO avoid this we have
private void writeObject()
private void readObject() methods

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 225) Can we serilize the static variable?
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  No we can't serilize the static variable. because static belong to the class and serlize belong to the object.
  
 226) static and final with serilization?
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  final variable get serilizaed like other non-static variable.
  static variable will not serilized in java
  
 227) Steps procudure to use the rabbiMq?
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) For using rabbit mq we need to install the erlang software
  2) We can use also on web i.e https://customer.cloudamqp.com/login
  cloudamqp
  3) we need to copy that url and paste into your application.properties folder.
  4) Then we need to add the dependecy 
     RabbitMQ
    
  5) @Autowired
      RabbitTemplate rabbitTemplate;
      
      we need pass queue name in the send and convert method.
      
      Queue-means pool of messaging.
      we need to use the quque from advanced messaging queue protocol.
      and send anc convert message is used for the sending messaging.
      
     @Autowired
     RabbitListner(queueu="queue_name")
     RabbitListner is used to listening the messages.
     
     Once the message is listen is will gone forever.

to make the connection we need 
queue manager name
ip address
port number
after that you can create your own queuee .ie local quques or remote queuq


  228) Steps required to use the activemq?
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   1) First we need to lownload the activemq.
   2) Then we need to run activemq on cmd ( Or inside that folder we have 
      axtivemq start file we need to start it.
   3) specifiy the properties inside the application.properties file of your application.
   4) JMSTemplate we used to send the message in the form of queue.
   5) For listening the message we have 
      JMSListner we need to use

  229) Steps to connect and use IBM MQ ?
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  i) you need to add the IBM MQ dependencye into your application.
  ii) add connection properties into yaml file.
  iii) After that using JmsTemplate you can send and recevie the messages.

     
  229) What is the use of serial version id?
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
i) While serilization and deserilization we need serial version id.
ii) Serial version id means maintain the compitability while performing the serilization and deserilization. 
  
  230) How divison and mode operator works?
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) division for integer
     int a=26,int b=15;
     int c=a/b;
          =26/15 =1.7
	  
     c will print only 1 because integer values.
     division consider quetioent only. 
     
  2) modulus operator 
     int a=26,int b=15
     
     int c=a%b;
           =25%16= 1 /25-16= 11
	   
	  c will gives us 11 as a output
	  It will consider the remainder.
  
  
  
   231) How to through manual exception check our logic?
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   just create one method where or which method you want to get or occur the exception 
   testMethod();

   Now provide the method or create the method
   private void testMethod(){
    String s=null;
    s.toString();
     }
  }

  
232) How to find out non required or non used depedecies in our project?

   3) How to check form putty session - using below commond
      ps -ef | grep -i <applName>


235) How to clone object in java ? 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In java there are two ways we can copied object.
A) Shallow Copy
B) Deep Copy

A) Shallow Copy - 
i) Shallow copy creating a new object with help of reference of original object.
ii) In Shallow copy if you make change in child object it will affect the original object and vice-versa
iii) There is join between original and cloned object.


B) Deep copy
i) Deep copy means creating new object by with help of original object.
ii) In deep copy if you make change in child object , it won't affect the original object and vice-versa.
ii) Deep copy there is disjoin between the original and deeped copy object.
iii) There is no join between the original and cloned object.

  
  237) When to use logger.info(),logger.debug(),logger.error()?
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Logger class has these method, we have logging api also.
  logger.info() used to log info message.
  
  logger.error() used to log error message 
  {for eg.if any exception occured we will use it in catch block).
  
  logger.debug() we used to see logs while debuging some problems.
  
  
  238) Difference between logger.info() and logger.debug()?
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  logger.info() gives us information like application is in best state.
  where as logger.debug() gives us information while debugging some problems.
  
  239) How to add parameters in log?
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  import org.slf4j.Logger;
  import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;		
  
  Logger logger=LoggerFactory.getLogger(CLASSNAME.class);
  
  logger.info("We are excepection the number {} ",number);
  
  240) Callback if exception occured some scenarioes also rollback the transaction 
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  class A{
     
     B b=new B();
     @Transaction(propagation=Propagation.REQUIRED_NEW,rollbackFor=Exception.class)
     public void a(A a){
     try{
          b.b(a);
	  }catch(Exception e){

               }
         }
    }
  
  
  class B {
   C c=new C();
  @Transaction(propagation=Propagation.REQUIRED,rollbackFor=Exception.class)
   public void b(A a) throws Exception{
      c.b(a);     
       }
   }
   
   class C {
  
  //suppose this method is common and calling from lot's of classes so instead of modifing all
  //classes we can use try with catch block.
  D d=new D();
  @Transaction(propagation=Propagation.REQUIRED,rollbackFor=Exception.class)
   public void b(A a) {
         
	  try{
	   d.b(a);
	   }catch(Exception e){
             throw new RuntimeException(e);
            }
       }
   }
   
   Also some where if you are not able to handle throws exception then you can use try and catch block just throw new RuntimeException(e); in
   catch block.
   
   
   class D{
   @Transaction(propagation=Propagation.REQUIRED,rollbackFor=Exception.class)
    public void b(A a) throws Exception {
    
     }
   }
   
   

   Transaction basicallyh getting used to avoid data inconsisteny in our application , what it does basically it will not commit
   unitl transaction get completed.
   If there is any database related exception occur , it will roller those records.

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
   
   241) What is @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy annotations?
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    @PostConstruct annotations is used for init() method.that means this method executed only once
    just after the initilization bean.(method level anntoations)
    
    
    @PreDestroy annotations is method level annotations. The method executed just before the object get
    destroyed.

   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
i) code reuse
ii) avoid unnecessary db calls
iii) try to use cache


  244) Enum
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) Enum is nothing but way to define constant in java.
  2) Enum never get instatiated , or extends.
  3) It has constructor , implicity private.
  4) The purpose of parameterized constructor is provide more info along with enum.

  enum College{
   
   private String collegeName;
   private Integer collegeCode;

   private College(String collegeName,Integer collegeCode){
      this.collegeName=collegeName;
      this.collegeCode=collegeCode;  
  }

  public String getCollegeName(){
       return collegeName;
  }

  public Integer getCollegeCode(){
       return collegeCode;
  }

  public College getCollge(String collegeName){
       for(College collge : Collge.Values()){
          if(collge.getCollgeName.eqaulIngonreCase(collegeName)){
             return collge;
          }
       }
  return null;
  }
  }

  
  245) Loop
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  if(contion 1){
   --------
  }else if(condition 2){
  *****
  }else if(condtion 3){
  ####
  }else{
  _______
  }
  
  If condtion 1 satisfied then controller direclty goes out
  If condition 1fail then controller goes to check second con
  if second is true then it direclty becomes out.
  
  
  
  
  if(){
  
  }else if(){
  
  }else if(){
  
  }
  if(){
  
  }if(){
  
  }else{
  
  }
   
   
   
   1)The above method we can see first if method condition first get checked, 
   if it is true , 
   then call go to
   2) direct if() method ,
      then if() method
      
  *****Imp here is if and else if call 
   
   
   246) How to take call back to collar of method if any exception occurs?
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   1) don't handle the exception
   2) always throws the exception
   3) if you are using try and catch block
      then throw new RuntimeException(); in catch block

  248) How to convert String into jsonObject?
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Using GSON we can convert String to Json Object.
  GSON is main class of Google library.
  
  249) What is the use of ObjectMapper in java?
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ObjectMapper is used to convert java object into json string.
  ObjectMapper objectMapper=new ObjectMapper();
  objectMapper.writeValueAsAString(paramter);	
  
  
 251) What is typecasting error in java?
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Typecasting error occures when jvm unable to convert one data type to another data type.
 suppose a one attributes want int type data and you are passing string so you will get 
 java.lang.typecastexpection
  
   
 252) Explain the execution of for loop ?
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
first int i=0 initilzation , it will execute only once 
second i<=5 ; condition it iwll execute if it is true then for loop will execute 
third increment/decrement i++ will execute
again condition get execute then for loop if is a true then the increment or decrement
for(int i=0; i<=5 ;i++)

1) What's loop?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 loop is used to execute set of instruction repeatetively when some condition becomes true.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
2) When will you use for loop?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) If the number of iteration is fixed we will use for loop 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) When will you use while loop?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) While loop used when no of iteration is not fixed
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
4) When will you use do-while loop?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
do while loop is used when the no. of iteration is not fixed and you want to execute one statement.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) What's switch case?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Switch case is used to execute one condition from multiple.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6) What's break?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Break is used to directly terminate the loop,It used in loop and switch case.
Break comes under the jump statement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
7) What's continue?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Continue means doesn't terminate the loop come to next iteration.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
8) What is upcasting ?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reference variable of parent class referes to the objects of child class
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
110) 
for( int i=0;i<=5;i++)
{

}
1) time complexity o(n)    -no of time the loop is executed

for( int i=0;i<=5/2;i++)
{

}
2) olog(n) --- constant we need calcualte 

3) for( int i=0;i<=arr.length;i++){
for( int j=0;j<=arr.length;j++)
o2n


log(n) best 


111) Enhanced for loop Vs old For Loop

    Enhanced For loop 
    i) Enhanced for loop we don't have index based access.
    ii) It will iterate each element of list, set or array.
    iii) It is very simple to use.
    iv) It is less flexible than the old for loop.
    v) It traverse only forward direction.

    For loop
     i) For loop we have index based element access.
     ii) It will iterate the based on the condition.
     iii) It is complex to use.
     iv) It is more flexible.  
     v) It traverse both direction i.e., forward and reverse.
     vi) It has more control over the loop such as , initilization , conditional and update.  


112) What happen if i write
     Map<Integer> map=new HashMap<Integer>();
     
     It will show compile time error because HashMap represent key value pair

113) How to acheive inheritance in java?
     By using extends keywords in java
     
     class Bank{
     }
     class SBI Extends Bank{
     
     }

     SBI IS-A Bank

114) How to achieve associtation?
     Associtation we can achieve direclty or by using new keyword.
     Association means all object have their own life and there is no owner.
     
     class Student {
         private int rollNo;
     
         private String name;
     
     }
     
     student has a rollNo;
     student has a name;
     
     Class Car{
         private Engine engine;
     
         public Car(){
                 engine=new Engine();
                     }
         }
     Class Engine{

     }
     
     
     
     Inside the association we have two concepts like
     1) Aggregation  (Weak relationship) Car has music player
     
        Class Employee{
	      private int id;
	      
	      private String name;
	      
	      Address address;
	     
	 }
 
       Class Address{
       
       }
	      
     
     
     2) Composition  (Strong relationship) Car has a Engine
     
        Class Car{
	 private Engine engine;
	 
	 public Car(){
	     engine=new Engine();
	     
	   }
	   
	 }
	
	class Engine{
	
	}
	
	 
     
     
     
       Association means no tightly coupled where as inheritance means tightly copuled.
       for eg- A Car has a music system
       Compostion Car has a engine
       
     
 115) Inheritance is tightly coupled because classed dependes upon each other or we can say blood relations.
 
 116) When we get null pointer exception in java?
      When your object reference refer to the null values.
      
 117) What is typecasting?
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Convert one data type into another data type.
 
    
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) PreIncrement Pre Decrement
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PreIncrement - 
It increase itself and again it's values.

int a=10;

a=a+(++a)+a+a;  //10+11+11+11
System.out.println(a); //43


Pre-Decrement-
It decrease value itself and again the values
int a=10;

a=a+(--a)+a+a; //10+9+9+9;
System.out.println(a); //37


Post-Increment
It increase value after itself.
int a=10;
a=a+(a++)+a+a; //10+10+11+11;
System.out.println(a); //42

Post-Decrement
It descrease value after itself
int a=10;
a=a+(a--)+a+a;//10+10+9+9=38
System.out.println(a);//38

1) What does assertEqual work?
assertEqual check wheather two objects equal or not.
